## Analysis

The toy rental company `SpielGut` wants us to implement a web application for managing
the rentals and letting users register themselves and manage their accounts and rentals.  
The web application **will not** handle toy management, as this is already implemented in their
Desktop application.  

##### Requirements for the application are:
 * users can register themselves
 * users can login to their accouns
 * users *have to* fill in their personal data after the first login
 * users can view and edit their personal data once logged in
 * users can make a rental for a toy
 * users can view all their past rentals


### Planing
